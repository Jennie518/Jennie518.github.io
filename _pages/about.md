I’m deeply engaged in software development at the University of Utah, anticipating my graduation in December 2024. As an aspiring full-stack engineer with a keen interest in web development, I am actively seeking internships that allow me to apply my skills in full-stack development. My background in Biological Science provides a unique perspective, enhancing my approach to innovative tech solutions and enriching my problem-solving strategies in the tech landscape.

A bit more about me:

🎯 I'm a goal-driven person (MBTI:ISTP)

🍳 I like Asian food and creating new recipes

📸 Photography: I like portrait photography and nature scenery 

📚 The Courage to Be Disliked

📺 Friends

🎶Coldplay, Taylor Swift

🎬 Soul, Little Woman

🤝 Let's connect and make tech even more awesome!
