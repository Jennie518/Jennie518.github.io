In this project, I developed a Sokoban game using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). My goal was to create a game that challenges players with engaging puzzles that require strategic thinking and careful planning. I focused on using C++ to implement complex game logic and SFML to manage the graphical interface, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay. This game not only demonstrates my technical skills but also my passion for combining classic game design with modern programming techniques.
